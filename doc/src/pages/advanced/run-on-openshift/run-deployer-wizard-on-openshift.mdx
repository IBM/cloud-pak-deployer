# Running deployer wizard as a pod for existing OpenShift cluster

## Log in to the OpenShift cluster
Log is as a cluster administrator to be able to run the deployer with the correct permissions.

## Prepare the deployer project
```
oc new-project cloud-pak-deployer 

oc project cloud-pak-deployer
oc create serviceaccount cloud-pak-deployer-sa
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z cloud-pak-deployer-sa
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin -z cloud-pak-deployer-sa
```

## Build deployer image and push to the internal registry
Building the deployer image typically takes ~5 minutes. Only do this if the image has not been built yet.
```
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImageStream
metadata:
  name: cloud-pak-deployer
spec:
  lookupPolicy:
    local: true
EOF

cat << EOF | oc create -f -
kind: Build
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  generateName: cloud-pak-deployer-bc-
  namespace: cloud-pak-deployer
spec:
  serviceAccount: builder
  source:

    git:
      uri: 'https://github.com/IBM/cloud-pak-deployer'
      ref: main
  strategy:

    dockerStrategy: {}
  output:
    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: 'cloud-pak-deployer:latest'
  triggeredBy:
    - message: Manually triggered
EOF
```

Now, wait until the deployer image has been built.
```
oc get build -n cloud-pak-deployer -w
```

## Start the deployer wizard

```

## Expose the service and create the route
```
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: cloud-pak-deployer-wizard-svc
  namespace: cloud-pak-deployer    
spec:
  selector:                  
    app: cloud-pak-deployer-wizard
  ports:
  - nodePort: 0
    port: 8080            
    protocol: TCP
EOF

cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route

spec:
  tls:

    kind: Service

    weight: null
EOF
```

Now you can access the deployer wizard using the route created in teh `cloud-pak-deployer` project.
