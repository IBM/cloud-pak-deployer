# Running deployer as a pod for existing OpenShift cluster

## Collect cluster credentials
* Cluster: ...
* OpenShift admin user: `kubeadmin`
* Password: ...

## Login to cluster
```
oc login ... --insecure-skip-tls-verify
```

Keep the login command, you will need it later to set the vault secret the deployer will use.

## Create configuration
```
export CONFIG_DIR=$PWD/cpd-config && mkdir -p $CONFIG_DIR/config

```

Building the deployer image typically takes ~5 minutes. Only do this if the image has not been built yet.

The OpenShift job consists of 2 containers: `wait-config` and `cloud-pak-deployer`, where the `wait-config` is an "init" container, just waiting for the signal that the deployer can start. In the next steps, the deployer configuration and secrets are created inside the pod, then the configuration is marked "ready" and deployment can start.

## Copy local configuration and status directory into deployer pod
```
export DEPLOYER_POD=$(oc get po --no-headers -l app=cloud-pak-deployer | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
```

## Prepare for deployer run
```
oc rsh -c wait-config $DEPLOYER_POD /cloud-pak-deployer/cp-deploy.sh vault set \
  -vs cp_entitlement_key -vsv "your_entitlement_key"
oc rsh -c wait-config $DEPLOYER_POD /cloud-pak-deployer/cp-deploy.sh vault set \
  -vs cpd-demo-oc-login -vsv "your_oc_login_command"
oc rsh -c wait-config $DEPLOYER_POD /cloud-pak-deployer/cp-deploy.sh vault set \
  -vs cp4d_admin_cpd_instance_cpd_demo -vsv "your_cp4d_admin_password"

oc rsh -c wait-config $DEPLOYER_POD /cloud-pak-deployer/cp-deploy.sh vault list
```

## Mark the configuration ready to start the deployment
```
oc rsh -c wait-config $DEPLOYER_POD bash -c 'touch /tmp/cpd-config-ready; chmod 777 /tmp/cpd-config-ready'
```

## Follow the logs of the deployment
```
oc logs -f $DEPLOYER_POD
```

In some cases, especially if the OpenShift cluster is remote from where the `oc` command is running, the `oc logs -f` command may terminate abruptly.
