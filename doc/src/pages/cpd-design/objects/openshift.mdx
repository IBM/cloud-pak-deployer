# OpenShift configuration

The sections below cover the OpenShift configuration, followed by advanced configuration such as:

- [Upstream DNS servers](#upstream-dns-servers)
- [OpenShift logging](#openshift-logging)

## `openshift`

For OpenShift, there are 5 flavours:

- [OpenShift on IBM Cloud](#openshift-on-ibm-cloud)
- [OpenShift on vSphere](#openshift-on-vsphere)
- [OpenShift on AWS - ROSA](#openshift-on-aws-rosa)
- [OpenShift on AWS - self-managed](#openshift-on-aws-self-managed)
- [OpenShift on Microsoft Azure (ARO)](<#openshift-on-microsoft-azure-(aro)>)
- [Existing OpenShift](#existing-openshift)

Every OpenShift cluster consists of a few mandatory properties that control which version of OpenShift is installed, the number and type of control plane and compute nodes and the underlying infrastructure, dependent on the cloud platform on which it is provisioned. Additionally, one can configure [upstream DNS servers](#upstream-dns-servers) and storage definitions.

### OpenShift on IBM Cloud (ROKS)
VPC-based OpenShift cluster on IBM Cloud, using the Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Services (ROKS).

The `managed` attribute indicates whether the ROKS cluster is managed by the Cloud Pak Deployer. If set to `False`, the deployer will not provision the ROKS cluster but expects it to already be available in the VPC. You can still use the deployer to create the VPC, the subnets, NFS servers and other infrastructure, but first run it without an `openshift` element. Once the VPC has been created, manually create an OpenShift cluster in the VPC and then add the `openshift` element with `managed` set to `False`. If you intend to use OpenShift Container Storage, you must also activate the add-on and create the `OcsCluster` custom resource.

<InlineNotification kind="warning">
  If you set `infrastructure.private_only` to `True`, the server from which you run the deployer must be able to access the ROKS cluster via its private endpoint, either by establishing a VPN to the cluster's VPC, or by making sure the deployer runs on a server that has a connection with the ROKS VPC via a transit gateway.

<InlineNotification kind="warning">
  You are not allowed to specify the OCP version of the ARO cluster. The latest current version is provisioned automatically instead no matter what value is
  specified in the "ocp_version" parameter. The "ocp_version" parameter is mandatory for compatibility with other layers of the provisioning, such as the OpenShift client. For
  instance, the value is used by the process which downloads and installs the `oc` client. Please, specify the value according to what OCP version will be provisioned.

### Existing OpenShift

When using the Cloud Pak Deployer on an existing OpenShift cluster, the scripts assume that the cluster is already operational and that any storage classes have been pre-created. The deployer accesses the cluster through a vault secret with the kubeconfig information; the name of the secret is `<name>-kubeconfig`.

```

##### infastructure.type - Type of infrastructure
When deploying on existing OpenShift, the underlying infrastructure can pose some restrictions on capabilities available. For example, Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud (aka ROKS) does not include the Machine Config Operator and ROSA on AWS does not allow to set labels for Machine Config Pools. This means that node settings required for Cloud Pak for Data must be applied in a non-standard manner.

The following values are allowed for `infrastructure.type`:
* `detect` (default): The deployer will attempt to detect the underlying cloud infrastructure. This is done by retrieving the existing storage classes and then inferring the cloud type.
* `standard`: The deployer will assume a standard OpenShift cluster with no further restrictions. This is the fallback value for `detect` if the underlying infra cannot be detected. 
* `aws-self-managed`: A self-managed OpenShift cluster on AWS. No restrictions.
* `aws-rosa`: Managed Red Hat OpenShift on AWS. Some restrictions with regards to Machine Config Pools apply.
* `azure-aro`: Managed Red Hat OpenShift on Azure. No known restrictions.
* `vsphere`: OpenShift on vSphere. No known restrictions.

| storage_type            | Type of storage class to use in the OpenShift cluster                                       | Yes                               | nfs, ocs, aws-elastic, auto, custom |
| ocp_storage_class_file  | OpenShift storage class to use for file storage if different from default for storage_type  | Yes if `storage_type` is `custom` |                                     |
| ocp_storage_class_block | OpenShift storage class to use for block storage if different from default for storage_type | Yes if `storage_type` is `custom` |                                     |

**The custom storage_type can be used in case you want to use a non-standard storage class(es). In this case the storage class(es) must be already configured on the OCP cluster and set in the respective ocp_storage_class_file and ocp_storage_class_block variables**

**The auto storage_type will let the deployer automatically detect the storage type based on the existing storage classes in the OpenShift cluster.**

## Advanced configuration

### Upstream DNS servers

When deploying OpenShift in a private network, one may want to reach additional private network services by their host name. Examples could be a database server, Hadoop cluster or an LDAP server.  OpenShift provides a DNS operator which deploys and manages CoreDNS which takes care of name resolution for pods running inside the container platform, also known as DNS forwarding.

```
  upstream_dns:
  - name: sample-dns
    zones:
    - example.com
    dns_servers:
    - 172.31.2.73:53
```

The zones which have been defined for each of the upstream_dns configurations control which DNS server(s) will be used for name resolution. For example, if `example.com` is given as the zone and an upstream DNS server of `172.31.2.73:53`, any host name matching `*.example.com` will be resolved using DNS server `172.31.2.73` and port `53`.

If you want to remove the upstream DNS that was previously configured, you can change the deployer configuration as below and run the deployer. Removing the `upstream_dns` element altogether will not make changes to the OpenShift DNS operator.

```
  upstream_dns: []
```

See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/networking/dns-operator.html for more information about the operator that is configured by specifying upstream DNS servers.

### OpenShift logging

Defines how OpenShift forwards the logs to external log collectors. Currently, the following log collector types are supported:

- loki

The `logging_output` element is mandatory and defines the external log collector(s) used by the inputs that have been defined. Besides the cluster wide logging inputs, audit logs can also be sent to the external log collector(s) for Cloud Pak for Data using the `cp4d_audit_config` object.

```
openshift_logging:
- openshift_cluster_name: sample
  configure_es_log_store: False
  cluster_wide_logging:
  - input: application
    logging_name: loki-application
    labels:
      cluster_name: "{{ env_id }}"
      cloud_region: eu-de
  - input: infrastructure
    logging_name: loki-application
    labels:
      cluster_name: "{{ env_id }}"
  - input: audit
    logging_name: loki-audit
    labels:
      cluster_name: "{{ env_id }}"
  logging_output:
  - name: loki-application
    type: loki
    url: https://loki-application.sample.com
    certificates:
      cert: "{{ env_id }}-loki-cert"
      key: "{{ env_id }}-loki-key"
      ca: "{{ env_id }}-loki-ca"
  - name: loki-audit
    type: loki
    url: https://loki-audit.sample.com
    certificates:
      cert: "{{ env_id }}-loki-cert"
      key: "{{ env_id }}-loki-key"
      ca: "{{ env_id }}-loki-ca"
