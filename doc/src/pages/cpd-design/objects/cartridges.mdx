# Cloud Pak Cartridges

## Cloud Pak for Data cartridges

### `cp4d.cartridges`
This is a list of cartridges that will be installed in the Cloud Pak for Data instance. Every cartridge is identified by its name.

By default, the `case_version`, `subscription_channel` and `version` properties are retrieved using **olm-utils** using the `cp4d_version` property at the `cp4d` level. If you wish you can override the inferred values by specifying them at the cartridge level but this is typically not necessary.

<InlineNotification kind="warning">
Use with care: If you decide to override the inferred values, this may have unexpected consequences as there are dependencies between some cartridges. For example: both Watson Studio (ws) and Watson Knowledge Catalog (wkc) use the Common Core Services (ccs). If you choose to override the version for ws, the ccs version installed may not be compatible with wkc.

Some cartridges may require additional information to correctly install or to create an instance for the cartridge. Below you will find a list of all tested cartridges and their specifics.
