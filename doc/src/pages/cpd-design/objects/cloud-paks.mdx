# Cloud Pak configuration

- [Cloud Pak for Data](#cp4d)
- [Cloud Pak for Integration](#cp4i)

### `cp4d`
Defines the Cloud Pak for Data instances to be configured on the OpenShift cluster(s).
```
cp4d:
- project: zen-40
  openshift_cluster_name: sample
  cp4d_version: 4.0.9
  use_case_files: False
  olm_utils: False
  change_node_settings: True
  accept_licenses: False
  image_registry_name: cpd404
  openshift_storage_name: nfs-storage
  
  cartridges:
  - name: cpfs
  - name: cpd_platform
```

#### Properties
| Property | Description                                                          | Mandatory | Allowed values |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| project  | Name of the OpenShift project of the Cloud Pak for Data instance     | Yes       |  |
| openshift_cluster_name | Name of the OpenShift cluster                  | Yes       | Existing `openshift` cluster |
| cp4d_version | Cloud Pak for Data version to install, this will determine the version for all cartridges that do not specify a version | Yes | 4.x.x |
| use_case_files | This property indicates whether or not the case files will be used to install the catalog sources in case of an online install from the entitled registry. If `true`, operator case files are downloaded from the case repository to define the catalog sources. If a private registry has been specified (property `image_registry_name`), it is assumed that case file are used to install the catalog sources.                | No       | True, False (default) |
| olm_utils | If set to `True` the deployer will use the **OLM utils** to install catalog sources, subscriptions and CRs | No | False (default), True |
| change_node_settings | Controls whether the node settings using the machine configs will be applied onto the OpenShift cluster. | No | True, False |
| accept_licenses | Set to 'True' to accept Cloud Pak licenses. Alternatively the `--accept-all-licenses` can be used for the `cp-deploy.sh` command | Yes | True, False |
| image_registry_name | When using private registry, specify name of `image_registry` | No       |  |
| openshift_storage_name | References an `openshift_storage` element in the OpenShift cluster that was defined for this Cloud Pak for Data instance. The name must exist under `openshift.[openshift_cluster_name].openshift_storage. | No, inferred | |
| cartridges | List of cartridges to install for this Cloud Pak for Data instance. See [Cloud Pak for Data cartridges](/cpd-design/objects/cartridges) for more details | Yes | |

### `image_registry`
Defines a private registry that will be used for pulling the Cloud Pak container images from. Additionally, if the Cloud Pak entitlement key was specified at run time of the deployer, the images defined by the case files will be mirrored to this private registry.
```
image_registry:
- name: cpd404
  registry_host_name: cpd404.example.com
  registry_port: 5000
  registry_namespace: cpd404
  registry_insecure: false
  registry_trusted_ca_secret: cpd404-ca-bundle
```

#### Properties
| Property | Description                                                          | Mandatory | Allowed values |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| name     | Name by which the image registry is identified.                      | Yes       |  |
| registry_host_name | Host name of the registry server/service.                  | Yes       |  |
| registry_port | Port that the image registry listens on. Default is the https port (443) | No | |
| registry_namespace | Namespace (path) within the registry that holds the Cloud Pak images. Mandatory only when using the IBM Cloud Container Registry (ICR)    | No       | |
| registry_insecure | Defines whether insecure registry access with a self-signed certificate is allowed | No       | True, False (default) |
| registry_trusted_ca_secret | Defines the vault secret which holds the certificate authority bundle that must be used when connecting to this private registry. This parameter cannot be specified if `registry_insecure` is also specified. | No       |  |

When mirroring images, the deployer connects to the registry using the host name and port. If the port is omitted, the standard https protocol (443) is used. If a `registry_namespace` is specified, for example when using the IBM Container Registry on IBM Cloud, it will be appended to the registry URL.

The user and password to connect to the registry will be retrieved from the vault, using secret `image-registry-<your_image_registry_name>` and must be stored in the format `registry_user:registry_password`. For example, if you want to connect to the image registry `cpd404` with user `admin` and password `very_s3cret`, you would create a secret as follows:
```
./cp-deploy.sh vault set \
  -vs image-registry-cpd404 \
  -vsv "admin:very_s3cret"
```

If you need to connect to a private registry which is not signed by a public certificate authority, you have two choices:
* Store the PEM certificate that that holds the CA bundle in a vault secret and specify that secret for the `registry_trusted_ca_secret` property. This is the recommended method for private registries.
* Specify `registry_insecure: false` (not recommended): This means that the registry (and port) will be marked as insecure and OpenShift will pull images from it, even if its certificate is self-signed.

For example, if you have a file `/tmp/ca.crt` with the PEM certificate for the certificate authority, you can do the following:
```
./cp-deploy.sh vault set \
  -vs cpd404-ca-bundle \
  -vsf /tmp/ca.crt
```

This will create a vault secret which the deployer will use to populate a `configmap` in the `openshift-config` project, which in turn is referenced by the `image.config.openshift.io/cluster` custom resource. For the above configuration, configmap `cpd404-ca-bundle` would be created and teh `image.config.openshift.io/cluster` would look something like this:
```
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Image
metadata:
...
...
  name: cluster
spec:
  additionalTrustedCA:
    name: cpd404-ca-bundle
```

## `cp4i`
Defines the Cloud Pak for Integration installation to be configured on the OpenShift cluster(s).

```
cp4i:

- project: cp4i
  openshift_cluster_name: {{ env_id }}
  openshift_storage_name: nfs-rook-ceph
  cp4i_version: 2021.4.1
  use_case_files: True
  accept_licenses: False
  use_top_level_operator: False
  top_level_operator_channel: v1.5
  top_level_operator_case_version: 2.5.0
  operators_in_all_namespaces: True
 
  instances:

  - name: integration-navigator
    type: platform-navigator
    license: L-RJON-C7QG3S
    channel: v5.2
    case_version: 1.5.0
```


#### OpenShift projects

The immediate content of the cp4i object is actually a list of OpenShift projects (namespaces). There can be more than one project and instances can be created in separate projects.

```yaml
cp4i:
- project: cp4i
  ...

- project: cp4i-ace
  ...

- project: cp4i-apic
  ...

```

#### Operator channels, CASE versions, license IDs

Before you run the Cloud Pak Deployer be sure that the correct operator channels are defined for the selected instance types. Some products require a license ID, please check the documentation of each product for the correct license. If you decide to use CASE files instead of the IBM Operator Catalog (more on that below) make sure that you selected the correct CASE versions - please refer: https://github.com/IBM/cloud-pak/tree/master/repo/case 


### Main properties

The following properties are defined on the project level:

| Property                        | Description |
|---------------------------------|-------------|
| project                         | The name of the OpenShift project that will be created and used for the installation of the defined instances. |
| openshift_cluster_name          | Dynamically defined form the `env_id` parameter during the execution. |
| openshift_storage_name          | Reference to the storage definition that exists in the *openshift* object (please see above). The definition must include the class name of the file storage type and the class name of the block storage type. |
| cp4i_version                    | The version of the Cloud Pak for Integration (e.g. 2021.4.1) |
| use_case_files                  | (Optional) Boolean value, *True* or *False*. If not specified, the default value is *False*. The property defines if the CASE files are used for installation. If it is True then the operator catalogs are created from the CASE files. If it is False, the *IBM Operator Catalog* from the entitled registry is used. |
| accept_licenses | Set to 'True' to accept Cloud Pak licenses. Alternatively the `--accept-all-licenses` can be used for the `cp-deploy.sh` command | Yes | True, False |
| use_top_level_operator          | (Optional) Boolean value, *True* or *False*. If not specified, the default value is *False*. If it is *True* then the CP4I top-level operator that installs all other operators is used. Otherwise, only the operators for the selected instance types are installed. |
| top_level_operator_channel      | Needed if the *use_top_level_operator* is *True* otherwise, it is ignored. Specifies the channel of the top-level operator. |
| top_level_operator_case_version | Needed if the *use_top_level_operator* is *True* otherwise, it is ignored. Specifies the CASE package version of the top-level operator. |
| operators_in_all_namespaces     | (Optional) Boolean value, *True* or *False*. If not specified, the default value is *False*. It defines whether the operators are visible in all namespaces or just in the specific namespace where they are needed.  |
| instances                       | List of the instances that are going to be created (please see below). |

>Note: Despite the properties *use_case_files*, *use_top_level_operator* and *operators_in_all_namespaces* are defined as optional, they are actually crucial for the way of execution of the installation process. If any of them is omitted, it is assumed that the default *False* value is used. If none of them exists, it means that all are *False*. In this case, it means that the *IBM Operator Catalog* is used and only the needed operators for specified instance types are installed in the specific namespace. 

### Properties of the individual instances

The *instance* property contains one or more instances definitions. Each instance must have a unique name. There can be more the one instance of the same type.

#### Naming convention for instance types

For each instance definition, an **instance type** must be specified. We selected the type names that are as much as possible similar to the naming convention used in the Platform Navigator use interface. The following table shows all existing types:


| Instance type              | Description/Product name |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| platform-navigator         | Platform Navigator |
| api-management             | IBM API Connect  |
| automation-assets          | Automation assets a.k.a Asset repo |
| enterprise-gateway         | IBM Data Power |
| event-endpoint-management  | Event endpoint manager - managing asynchronous APIs |
| event-streams              | IBM Event Streams - Kafka |
| high-speed-transfer-server | Aspera HSTS |
| integration-dashboard      | IBM App Connect Integration Dashboard |
| integration-design         | IBM App Connect Designer |
| integration-tracing        | Operations Dashboard |
| messaging                  | IBM MQ |


#### Platform navigator

The Platform Navigator is defined as one of the instance types. There is typically only one instance of it. The exception would be an installation in two or more completely separate namespaces (see the CP4I documentation). Special attention is paid to the installation of the Navigator. The Cloud Pak Deployer will install the Navigator instance first, before any other instance, and it will wait until the instance is ready (this could take up to 45 minutes).  

When the installation is completed, you will find the **admin** user password in the **status/cloud-paks/cp4i-<cluster_name>-cp4i-PN-access.txt** file. Of course, you can obtain the password also from the **platform-auth-idp-credentials** secret in **ibm-common-services** namespace.
