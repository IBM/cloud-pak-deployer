# Cloud Paks

Defines the Cloud Pak(s) which is/are layed out on the OpenShift cluster, typically in one or more OpenShift projects. The Cloud Pak definition represents the instance users connect to and which is responsible for managing the functional capabilities installed within the application. Cloud Pak for Data refers these capablities as services or cartridges.

An example Cloud Pak for Data object is below:
```
cp4d:
- project: zen-40
  openshift_cluster_name: sample
  cp4d_version: 4.0.9
  use_case_files: True
  olm_utils: False
  openshift_storage_name: ocs-storage
  
  cartridges:
  - name: cpfs
  - name: cpd_platform
```

The above Cloud Pak for Data object will install the control plane version 4.0.9 into project `zen-40` of OpenShift cluster `sample`. OpenShift Data Foundation (fka OCS) is used as the storage type for the control plane and cartridges.
