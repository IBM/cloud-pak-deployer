# Cloud Pak for Data instances

Some Cloud Pak for Data cartridges provide the capability as an instance (also sometimes referred to as a runtime). Examples of these are Cognos Analytics, Db2 OLTP, Db2 Warehouse, Analytics Engine and Data Virtualization. The deployer supports creation and deletion of cartridge instances based on the input configuration.

```
cp4d:
- project: zen-40
  openshift_cluster_name: {{ env_id }}
...
  - name: cognos_analytics
    size: small
    instances:
    - name: ca-instance
      metastore_ref: ca-metastore
    state: installed

  - name: db2
    size: small
    instances:
    - name: ca-metastore
      metadata_size_gb: 20
      data_size_gb: 20
      backup_size_gb: 20  
      transactionlog_size_gb: 20
    state: installed
```

In the above example, the Cognos Analytics and Db2 OLTP cartridges are installed by the deployer. Subsequently a Db2 instance is created to hold Cognos Analytics metastore. Finally, a new instance for Cognos Analytics is created, referencing the Db2 instance for the metastore.

Even though the Db2 instance is defined below the Cognos Analytics instance, the deployer will create the instances in the correct order.
