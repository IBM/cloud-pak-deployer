# Destroy the created resources

If you have previously used the Cloud Pak Deployer to create assets on IBM Cloud or AWS, you can destroy the assets with the same command.

<InlineNotification kind="info">
  Currently, destroy is only implemented for IBM Cloud ROKS and AWS ROSA, not
  for other cloud platforms.
</InlineNotification>

## Prepare for destroy

### Prepare for destroy on IBM Cloud

#### Set environment variables for IBM Cloud

```
export IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_api_key

export STATUS_DIR=/data/status/sample
export CONFIG_DIR=/data/config/sample
```

- `IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY`: This is the API key you generated using your IBM Cloud account, this is a 40+ character string
- `STATUS_DIR`: The directory where the Cloud Pak Deployer keeps all status information and log files. **Please note** that if you have chosen to use a File Vault, the directory specified must be the one you used when you created the environment
- `CONFIG_DIR`: Directory that holds the configuration. This must be the same directory you used when you created the environment

### Prepare for destroy on AWS

#### Set environment variables for AWS

We assume that the vault already holds the mandatory secrets for AWS Access Key, Secret Access Key and ROSA login token.

```
export STATUS_DIR=/data/status/sample
export CONFIG_DIR=/data/config/sample
```

- `STATUS_DIR`: The directory where the Cloud Pak Deployer keeps all status information and log files. **Please note** that if you have chosen to use a File Vault, the directory specified must be the one you used when you created the environment
- `CONFIG_DIR`: Directory that holds the configuration. This must be the same directory you used when you created the environment

## Run the Cloud Pak Deployer to destroy the assets

```
./cp-deploy.sh env destroy -e env_id=pluto-01 --confirm-destroy
```

Please ensure you specify the same extra (dynamic) variables that you used when you ran the `env apply` command.

When running the command, the container will start as a daemon and the command will tail-follow the logs. You can press Ctrl-C at any time to interrupt the logging but the container will continue to run in the background.

You can return to view the logs as follows:

```
./cp-deploy.sh env logs
```

If you need to interrupt the process, use CTRL-C to stop the logging output and then use:

```
./cp-deploy.sh env kill
```

## Finishing up

Once the process has finished successfully, you can delete the status directory.
