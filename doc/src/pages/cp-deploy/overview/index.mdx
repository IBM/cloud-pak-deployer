# Using the Cloud Pak Deployer
There are 3 main steps you need to perform to provision a Cloud Pak for Data on ROKS. We're assuming you're starting from scratch.

1. [Install the Cloud Pak Deployer](/cp-deploy/install)
2. [Configure the environment you want to deploy](/cp-deploy/configure)
3. [Run the Cloud Pak Deployer to create the cluster and install the Cloud Pak](/cp-deploy-run)
4. Optional: [Destroy the assets](/cp-deploy/destroy)
5. Optional: Run `oc` commands against the deployed environment [Open a command line](/cp-deploy/command)

## What will I need?
To complete the deployment, you will need the following. Details will be provided when you need them.
* A MacBook or Linux server/VM to run the Cloud Pak Deployer (unfortunately Microsoft Windows does not work at the moment)
* Docker or Podman installed on your MacBook or Linux server
* Git command or desktop
* A Git token to pull from the Git repository
* Your Cloud Pak entitlement key to pull images from the IBM Container Registry

Specifically, dependeding on the infrastructure:
* IBM Cloud VPC: An IBM Cloud API key that allows you to provision infrastructure
* vSphere: A vSphere user and password which has infrastructure create permissions
* Existing OpenShift: The `kubeconfig` file that allows you cluster admin access to the OpenShift cluster
