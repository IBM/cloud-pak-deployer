# Introduction

Gatsby themes encapsulate all of the configuration and implementation details of Gatsby websites. This GitHub repository has been built with a dependancy on the gatsby-theme-carbon package. The primary goal of gatsby-theme-carbon is to get content authors speaking the IBM Design Language with Carbon as soon as possible. This GiHub repository is connected to Travis any commit will cause a build of the GitHub pages to be triggered. A better way of working is to use the tooling from a loacal system

## Local tooling installation
If you want to test the documentation pages you're developing, it is best to run Gatsby in a container and map your local doc folder to a folder inside the container. This avoids having to install nvm and many modules on your workstation.

Do the following:
* Make sure you have cloned this repository to your workstation
* Install Docker on your workstation
* Start from the main directory of the cloud-pak-deployer repository
```
cd doc
docker build -t cpd-doc .
```

This will build a CentOS image with `nvm` and the required Node.js modules already installed. It will take ~5-10 minutes to complete this step, dependent on your network bandwidth.

## Running the docker image
```
docker run --name cpd-doc -d -p 8000:8000 -v $PWD:/doc cpd-doc:latest
```

This will start the docker container as a daemon. You can monitor its progress by tailing the logs.

```
docker logs -f cpd-doc 
```

It will take approximately 10 minutes to install all Node.js packages into the `node_modules` directory, this is only the first time. The `node_modules` directory is ignored by Git so it will no be synchronized with the upstream repository. Next time you start the container, it should take less than 1 minute.

Once finished, you will see the following message:
```output
✖ 6 problems (0 errors, 6 warnings)

success Building development bundle - 369.543s
```

Whenever you save changes to a document, the logs will show something:
```output
info changed file at /doc/src/pages/tools/development-setup.mdx
success building schema - 0.634s
info Total nodes: 147, SitePage nodes: 17 (use --verbose for breakdown)
success createPages - 0.004s
success Checking for changed pages - 0.001s
success update schema - 0.047s
success onPreExtractQueries - 0.001s
success extract queries from components - 0.624s
...
success Re-building development bundle - 2.436s
```

## Starting the browswer
Once you the container has fully started, it automatically tracks all changes in under the `doc` folder and updates the pages site automatically. You can view the site by opening a browswer for URL:

http://localhost:8000

## Stopping the docker container
If you don't want to test your changes locally anymore, stop the docker container.
```
docker kill cpd-doc
```

Next time you want to test your changes, you only have to run:
```
docker start cpd-doc
```

## Removing the docker container and image
If you want to remove all from your workstation, do the following:
```
docker rm -f cpd-doc
docker rmi -f cpd-doc:latest
```

Note that after pushing your updated documentation, a request will be sent to a Travis job that will rebuild the pages site. The Travis job can be followed at https://travis.ibm.com, you can login to follow the build using your github credentials.
