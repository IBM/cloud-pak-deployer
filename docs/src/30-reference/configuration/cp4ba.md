**Not for production use (neither dev nor test or prod environments). Suitable for Demo and PoC environments - but with Production deployment.**  

**!Important** - Keep in mind that this deployment contains capabilities (the ones which are not bundled with CP4BA) which are not eligible to run on Worker Nodes covered by CP4BA OCP Restricted licenses. More info on https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/1.0?topic=clusters-restricted-openshift-entitlement.

## Documentation base üìù

Deploying CP4BA is based on official documentation which is located at https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/latest.

Deployment of other parts is also based on respective official documentations.

- IBM Robotic Process Automation (RPA) https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/rpa/latest?topic=installing-rpa-red-hat-openshift-container-platform
- IBM Automation Assets https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/1.0?topic=foundation-automation-assets
- IBM Process Mining https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/process-mining/latest?topic=installing-red-hat-openshift-container-platform-environments
- IBM Automation Foundation (IAF) https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/1.0?topic=automation-foundation
- IBM Cloud Pak Foundational Services (CPFS) https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cpfs?topic=operator-installing-foundational-services-online

## Benefits üöÄ

- Automatic deployment of the whole platform where you don't need to take care about almost any prerequisites
- OCP Ingress certificate is used for Routes so there is only one certificate you need to trust in you local machine to trust all URLs of the whole platform
- Trusted certificate in browser also enable you to save passwords
- Wherever possible a common admin user *cpadmin* with adjustable password is used, so you don't need to remember multiple credentials when you want to access the platform (convenience also comes with responsibility - so you don't want to expose your platform to whole world)
- The whole platform is running on containers, so you don't need to manually prepare anything on traditional VMs and take care of them including required prerequisites
- Many otherwise manual post-deployment steps have been automated
- Pre integrated and automatically connected extras are deployed in the platform for easier access/management/troubleshooting
- You have a working Production deployment which you can use as a reference for further custom deployments

## General information üì¢

What is not included:

- ICCs - not covered.
- FNCM External share - Currently not supported with ZEN & IAM as per limitation on [FNCM limitations](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/22.0.1?topic=notes-known-limitations-issues#concept_gmf_x1h_1fb__ecm)
- Asset Repository is now omitted due to incompatibilities.
- Workflow Server and Workstream Services - this is a dev deployment. BAW Authoring and (BAW + IAWS) are mutually exclusive in single project.

## What is in the package üì¶

When you perform full deployment, as a result you will get full CP4BA platform as seen in the picture. You can also omit some capabilities - this is covered later in this doc.

More details about each section from the picture follows below it.
