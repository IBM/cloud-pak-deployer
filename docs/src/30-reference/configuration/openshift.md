# OpenShift cluster(s)

You can configure one or more OpenShift clusters that will be layed down on the specified infrastructure, or which already exist.

Dependent on the cloud platform on which the OpenShift cluster will be provisioned, different installation methods apply. For IBM Cloud, Terraform is used, whereas for vSphere the IPI installer is used. On AWS (ROSA), the `rosa` CLI is used to create and modify ROSA clusters. Each of the different platforms have slightly different properties for the `openshift` objects.

## `openshift`

For OpenShift, there are 5 flavours:

- [Existing OpenShift](#existing-openshift)
- [OpenShift on IBM Cloud](#openshift-on-ibm-cloud-roks)
- [OpenShift on AWS - ROSA](#openshift-on-aws---rosa)
- [OpenShift on AWS - self-managed](#openshift-on-aws---self-managed)
- [OpenShift on Microsoft Azure (ARO)](#openshift-on-microsoft-azure-aro)
- [OpenShift on vSphere](#openshift-on-vsphere)

Every OpenShift cluster definition of a few mandatory properties that control which version of OpenShift is installed, the number and flavour of control plane and compute nodes and the underlying infrastructure, dependent on the cloud platform on which it is provisioned. Storage is a mandatory element for every `openshift` definition. For a list of supported storage types per cloud platform, refer to [Supported storage types](#supported-storage-types).

Additionally, one can configure [Upstream DNS Servers](./dns.md) and [OpenShift logging](logging-auditing.md).

The `managed` attribute indicates whether the ROKS cluster is managed by the Cloud Pak Deployer. If set to `False`, the deployer will not provision the ROKS cluster but expects it to already be available in the VPC. You can still use the deployer to create the VPC, the subnets, NFS servers and other infrastructure, but first run it without an `openshift` element. Once the VPC has been created, manually create an OpenShift cluster in the VPC and then add the `openshift` element with `managed` set to `False`. If you intend to use OpenShift Container Storage, you must also activate the add-on and create the `OcsCluster` custom resource.

!!! warning
    If you set `infrastructure.private_only` to `True`, the server from which you run the deployer must be able to access the ROKS cluster via its private endpoint, either by establishing a VPN to the cluster's VPC, or by making sure the deployer runs on a server that has a connection with the ROKS VPC via a transit gateway.

#### Property explanation for OpenShift cluster on Microsoft Azure (ARO)

!!! warning
    You are not allowed to specify the OCP version of the ARO cluster. The latest current version is provisioned automatically instead no matter what value is specified in the "ocp_version" parameter. The "ocp_version" parameter is mandatory for compatibility with other layers of the provisioning, such as the OpenShift client. For instance, the value is used by the process which downloads and installs the `oc` client. Please, specify the value according to what OCP version will be provisioned.

### Existing OpenShift

When using the Cloud Pak Deployer on an existing OpenShift cluster, the scripts assume that the cluster is already operational and that any storage classes have been pre-created. The deployer accesses the cluster through a vault secret with the kubeconfig information; the name of the secret is `<name>-kubeconfig`.

##### infastructure.type - Type of infrastructure
When deploying on existing OpenShift, the underlying infrastructure can pose some restrictions on capabilities available. For example, Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud (aka ROKS) does not include the Machine Config Operator and ROSA on AWS does not allow to set labels for Machine Config Pools. This means that node settings required for Cloud Pak for Data must be applied in a non-standard manner.

The following values are allowed for `infrastructure.type`:

* `detect` (default): The deployer will attempt to detect the underlying cloud infrastructure. This is done by retrieving the existing storage classes and then inferring the cloud type.
* `standard`: The deployer will assume a standard OpenShift cluster with no further restrictions. This is the fallback value for `detect` if the underlying infra cannot be detected. 
* `aws-self-managed`: A self-managed OpenShift cluster on AWS. No restrictions.
* `aws-rosa`: Managed Red Hat OpenShift on AWS. Some restrictions with regards to Machine Config Pools apply.
* `azure-aro`: Managed Red Hat OpenShift on Azure. No known restrictions.
* `vsphere`: OpenShift on vSphere. No known restrictions.

##### openshift_storage[] - OpenShift storage definitions

| Property                | Description                                                                                 | Mandatory                         | Allowed values                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| storage_name            | Name of the storage definition, to be referenced by the Cloud Pak                           | Yes                               |                                     |
| storage_type            | Type of storage class to use in the OpenShift cluster                                       | Yes                               | nfs, ocs, aws-elastic, auto, custom |
| ocp_storage_class_file  | OpenShift storage class to use for file storage if different from default for storage_type  | Yes if `storage_type` is `custom` |                                     |
| ocp_storage_class_block | OpenShift storage class to use for block storage if different from default for storage_type | Yes if `storage_type` is `custom` |                                     |

!!! info
    The custom storage_type can be used in case you want to use a non-standard storage class(es). In this case the storage class(es) must be already configured on the OCP cluster and set in the respective ocp_storage_class_file and ocp_storage_class_block variables

!!! info
    The auto storage_type will let the deployer automatically detect the storage type based on the existing storage classes in the OpenShift cluster.

## Supported storage types
An `openshift` definition always includes the type(s) of storage that it will provide. When the OpenShift cluster is provisioned by the deployer, the necessary infrastructure and storage class(es) are also configured. In case an existing OpenShift cluster is referenced by the configuration, the storage classes are expected to exist already.

The table below indicates which storage classes are supported by the Cloud Pak Deployer per cloud infrastructure.

!!! warning
    The ability to provision or use certain storage types does not imply support by the Cloud Paks or by OpenShift itself. There are several restrictions for production use OpenShift Data Foundation, for example when on ROSA.

| Cloud Provider | NFS Storage | OCS/ODF Storage | Portworx | Elastic | Custom (2) |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| ibm-cloud      | Yes         | Yes             | Yes      | No      | Yes        |
| vsphere        | Yes (1)     | Yes             | No       | No      | Yes        |

| existing-ocp   | Yes         | Yes             | No       | Yes     | Yes        |

* (1) An existing NFS server can be specified so that the deployer configures the `managed-nfs-storage` storage class. The deployer will not provision or change the NFS server itself.
* (2) If you specify a `custom` storage type, you must specify the storage class to be used for block (RWO) and file (RWX) storage.
* (3) Specifying this storage type means that Elastic File Storage (EFS) and Elastic Block Storage (EBS) storage classes will be used. For EFS, an `nfs_server` object is required to define the "file server" storage on AWS.
