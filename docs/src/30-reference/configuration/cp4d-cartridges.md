# Cloud Pak for Data cartridges

Defines the services (cartridges) which must be installed into the Cloud Pak for Data instances. The cartridges will be configured with the storage class defined at the Cloud Pak for Data object level. For each cartridge you can specify whether it must be installed or removed by specifying the state. If a cartridge is installed and the state is changed to `removed`, the cartridge and all of its instances are removed by the deployer when it is run.

An example Cloud Pak for Data object with cartridges is below:
```
cp4d:
- project: cpd-instance
  cp4d_version: 4.8.3
  sequential_install: False

  cartridges:
  - name: cpfs

  - name: cpd_platform

  - name: db2oltp
    size: small
    instances:
    - name: db2-instance
      metadata_size_gb: 20
      data_size_gb: 20
      backup_size_gb: 20
      transactionlog_size_gb: 20
    state: installed

  - name: wkc
    size: small
    state: removed

  - name: wml
    size: small
    state: installed

  - name: ws
    state: installed
```

When run, the deployer installs the Db2 OLTP (`db2oltp`), Watson Machine Learning (`wml`) and Watson Studio (`ws`) cartridges. If the Watson Knowledge Catalog (`wkc`) is installed in the `cpd-instance` OpenShift project, it is removed.

After the deployer installs Db2 OLTP, a new Db2 instance is created with the specified attributes.
