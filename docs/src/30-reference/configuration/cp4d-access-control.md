# Cloud Pak for Data access control

Cloud Pak for Data can connect to an external identity provider (IdP) for user authentication. This function is delegated to Foundational Services IAM. Additional to user authentication, the IdP's groups can be mapped to Cloud Pak for Data user groups for access control.

### Roles - `zen_role`
Cloud Pak Deployer can be used to define user-defined roles in Cloud Pak for Data. Roles identify the permissions that a user or user group has on the platform.

```
zen_role:
- name: monitor-role
  description: User-defined role for monitoring the platform
  state: installed
  permissions:
  - monitor_platform
```

| Property               | Description                                                                            | Mandatory | Allowed values |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| name                   | Name of the Cloud Pak for Data role                                                    | Yes       |                |
| description            | Description of the Cloud Pak for Data role                                             | Yes       |                |
| state                  | Indicates if the role must be installed or removed same OpenShift cluster              | No        | installed (default), removed |
| permissions[]          | List of permissions to grant to the role                                               | Yes       |                |

To find the permissions that are allows, you can use the following REST API (GET) after authenticating to the platform: https://$CP4D_URL/icp4d-api/v1/permissions.

### Access Control - `zen_access_control`
The `zen_access_control` object controls the creation of Zen user groups that map identify provider (IdP) groups and define the roles of the user group. A `user_groups` entry must contain at least 1 `roles` and must reference the associated IdP grouop(s).

Example with Red Hat SSO (Keycloak) authentication
```
zen_access_control:
- project: cpd
  openshift_cluster_name: "{{ env_id }}"
  keycloak_name: ibm-keycloak
  user_groups:
  - name: cp4d-admins
    description: Cloud Pak for Data Administrators
    roles:
    - Administrator
    keycloak_groups:
    - kc-cp4d-admins
  - name: cp4d-data-engineers
    description: Cloud Pak for Data Data Engineers
    roles:
    - User
    keycloak_groups:
    - kc-cp4d-data-engineers
  - name: cp4d-data-scientists
    description: Cloud Pak for Data Data Scientists
    roles:
    - User
    keycloak_groups:
    - kc-cp4d-data-scientists
  - name: cp4d-monitor
    description: Cloud Pak for Data monitoring
    roles:
    - monitor-role
    keycloak_groups:

**`role` values:**
The following roles are defined by default in Cloud Pak for Data:
- Administrator
- User

Further roles can be defined in the `zen` object and can be referenced by the `user_groups.roles[]` property.

During the creation of User Group(s) the following validations are performed:
- The provided role(s) are available in Cloud Pak for Data

### Provisioned instance authorization - `cp4d_instance_configuration`
When using Cloud Pak for Data LDAP connectivity and User Groups, the User Groups can be assigned to authorize the users of the LDAP groups access to the proviosioned instance(s).

Currently supported instance authorization:  
- Cognos Analytics (ca)

#### Cognos Analytics instance authorization

![Cognos Analytics Authorization](images/cognos_authorization.png "Cognos Analytics Authorization")

```
cp4d_instance_configuration:
- project: zen-sample                # Mandatory
  openshift_cluster_name: sample     # Mandatory
  cartridges:
  - name: cognos_analytics
    manage_access:                                  # Optional, requires LDAP connectivity
    - ca_role: Analytics Viewer                     # Mandatory, one the CA Access roles
      cp4d_user_group: CA_Analytics_Viewer          # Mandatory, the CP4D User Group Name
    - ca_role: Analytics Administrators             # Mandatory, one the CA Access roles
      cp4d_user_group: CA_Analytics_Administrators  # Mandatory, the CP4D User Group Name
```

A Cognos Analytics (ca) instance can have multiple `manage_access` entries. Each entry consists of 1 `ca_role` and 1 `cp4d_user_group` element. 
The `ca_role` must be one of the following possible values:
- Analytics Administrators
- Analytics Explorers
- Analytics Users 
- Analytics Viewer

During the configuration of the instance authorization the following validations are performend:
- LDAP configuration is completed
- The provided `ca_role` is valid
- The provided `cp4d_user_group` exists

## Cloud Pak for Data LDAP configuration (deprecated)

![LDAP_Overview](images/ldap_user_groups.png "LDAP connection and User Groups")

IBM Cloud Pak for Data can connect to an LDAP user registry in order for users to log on with their LDAP credentials. The configuration of LDAP can be specified in a seperate yaml file in the `config` folder, or included in an existing yaml file.

### LDAP configuration - `cp4d_ldap_config`

A `cp4d_ldap_config` entry contains the connectivity information to the LDAP user registry. The `project` and `openshift_cluster_name` values uniquely identify the Cloud Pak for Data instance.
The `ldap_domain_search_password_vault` entry contains a reference to the vault, which means that as a preparation the LDAP bind user password must be stored in the vault used by the Cloud Pak Deployer using the key referenced in the configuration. 
If the password is not available, the Cloud Pak Deployer will fail and not able to configure the LDAP connectivity.

```
# Each Cloud Pak for Data Deployment deployed in an OpenShift Project of an OpenShift cluster can have its own LDAP configuration
cp4d_ldap_config:
- project: cpd-instance
  openshift_cluster_name: sample                                         # Mandatory
  ldap_host: ldaps://ldap-host                                           # Mandatory
  ldap_port: 636                                                         # Mandatory
  ldap_user_search_base: ou=users,dc=ibm,dc=com                          # Mandatory
  ldap_user_search_field: uid                                            # Mandatory
  ldap_domain_search_user: uid=ibm_roks_bind_user,ou=users,dc=ibm,dc=com # Mandatory
  ldap_domain_search_password_vault: ldap_bind_password                  # Mandatory, Password vault reference
  auto_signup: "false"                                                   # Mandatory
  ldap_group_search_base: ou=groups,dc=ibm,dc=com                        # Optional, but mandatory when using user groups
  ldap_group_search_field: cn                                            # Optional, but mandatory when using user groups
  ldap_mapping_first_name: cn                                            # Optional, but mandatory when using user groups
  ldap_mapping_last_name: sn                                             # Optional, but mandatory when using user groups
  ldap_mapping_email: mail                                               # Optional, but mandatory when using user groups
  ldap_mapping_group_membership: memberOf                                # Optional, but mandatory when using user groups
  ldap_mapping_group_member: member                                      # Optional, but mandatory when using user groups
```

The above configuration uses the LDAPS protocol to connect to port `636` on the `ldap-host` server. This server can be a private server if an upstream DNS server is also defined for the OpenShift cluster that runs Cloud Pak for Data. Common Name `uid=ibm_roks_bind_user,ou=users,dc=ibm,dc=com` is used as the bind user for the LDAP server and its password is retrieved from vault secret `ldap_bind_password`.
