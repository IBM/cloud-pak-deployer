# Using alternative repositories and registries

!!! warning
  In most scenarios you will not need this type of configuration. 

Alternative repositories and registries are mainly geared towards pre-GA use of the Cloud Paks where CASE files are downloaded from internal repositories and staging container image registries need to be used as images have not been released yet.

## Building the Cloud Pak Deployer image
By default the Cloud Pak Deployer image is built on top of the `olm-utils` images in `icr.io`. If you're working with a pre-release of the Cloud Pak OLM utils image, you can override the setting as follows:

```
export CPD_OLM_UTILS_V2_IMAGE=cp.staging.acme.com:4.8.0
```

Subsequently, run the install commmand:
```
./cp-deploy.sh build
```

## Configuring the alternative repositories and registries
When specifying a `cp_alt_repo` object in a YAML file, this is used for all Cloud Paks. The object triggers the following steps:
* The following files are created in the `/tmp/work` directory in the container: `play_env.sh`, `resolvers.yaml` and `resolvers_auth`.
* When downloading CASE files using the `ibm-pak` plug-in, the `play_env` sets the locations of the resolvers and authorization files.
* Also, the locations of the case files for the Cloud Pak, Foundational Servides and Open Content are set in an enviroment variable.
* Registry mirrors are configured using an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` resource in the OpenShift cluster.
* Registry credentials are added to the OpenShift cluster's global pull secret.

The `cp_alt_repo` is configured like this:
```
cp_alt_repo:
  repo:
    token_secret: github-internal-repo
    cp_path: https://raw.internal-repo.acme.com/cpd-case-repo/4.8.0/promoted/case-repo-promoted
    fs_path: https://raw.internal-repo.acme.com/cloud-pak-case-repo/main/repo/case
    opencontent_path: https://raw.internal-repo.acme.com/cloud-pak-case-repo/main/repo/case
  registry_pull_secrets:
  - registry: cp.staging.acme.com
    pull_secret: cp-staging
  - registry: fs.staging.acme.com
    pull_secret: cp-fs-staging
  registry_mirrors:
  - source: cp.icr.com/cp
    mirrors:
    - cp.staging.acme.com/cp
  - source: cp.icr.io/cp/cpd
    mirrors:
    - cp.staging.acme.com/cp/cpd
  - source: icr.io/cpopen
    mirrors:
    - fs.staging.acme.com/cp
  - source: icr.io/cpopen/cpfs
    mirrors:
    - fs.staging.acme.com/cp
```

## Configuring the secrets
Before running the deployer with a `cp_alt_repo` object, you need to ensure the referenced secrets are present in the vault.

For the GitHub token, you need to set the token (typically a deploy key) to login to GitHub or GitHub Enterprise.
```
./cp-deploy.sh vault set -vs github-internal-repo=abc123def456
```

For the registry credentials, specify the user and password separated by a colon (`:`):
```
./cp-deploy.sh vault set -vs cp-staging="cp-staging-user:cp-staging-password"
```

You can also set these tokens on the `cp-deploy.sh env apply` command line.
```
./cp-deploy.sh env apply -f -vs github-internal-repo=abc123def456 -vs cp-staging="cp-staging-user:cp-staging-password
```

## Running the deploy
To run the deployer you can now use the standard process:
```
./cp-deploy.sh env apply -v
```
