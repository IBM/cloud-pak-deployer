## Log in to the OpenShift cluster
Log is as a cluster administrator to be able to run the deployer with the correct permissions.

## Prepare the deployer project
```
oc new-project cloud-pak-deployer 

oc project cloud-pak-deployer
oc create serviceaccount cloud-pak-deployer-sa
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z cloud-pak-deployer-sa
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin -z cloud-pak-deployer-sa
```

## Build deployer image and push to the internal registry
Building the deployer image typically takes ~5 minutes. Only do this if the image has not been built yet.

```
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1

  name: cloud-pak-deployer

EOF
```

Now, wait until the deployer image has been built.
```
oc get build -n cloud-pak-deployer -w
```

## Set configuration
```
oc create cm -n cloud-pak-deployer cloud-pak-deployer-config
oc set data -n cloud-pak-deployer cm/cloud-pak-deployer-config \
  --from-file=$CONFIG_DIR/config
```

## Optional: start debug job
The debug job can be useful if you want to access the status directory of the deployer if the deployer job has failed.
```

```

## Follow the logs of the deployment
```
oc logs -f -n cloud-pak-deployer job/cloud-pak-deployer
```

In some cases, especially if the OpenShift cluster is remote from where the `oc` command is running, the `oc logs -f` command may terminate abruptly.
