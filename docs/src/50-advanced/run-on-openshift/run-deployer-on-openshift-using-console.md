## Follow the logs of the deployment
* Open the OpenShift console
* Go to Compute --> Pods
* Select `cloud-pak-deployer` as the project at the top of the page
* Click the deployer pod
* Click logs

## Re-run deployer when failed or if you want to update the configuration
If the deployer has failed or if you want to make changes to the configuration after the successful run, you can do the following:

* Open the OpenShift console
* Go to Workloads --> Jobs
* Delete the `cloud-pak-deployer` job including dependent assets. This will delete the job and also running/completed pod
* Make changes to the `cloud-pak-deployer-config` Config Map by going to Workloads --> ConfigMaps
* [Re-run the deployer](#run-the-deployer)
