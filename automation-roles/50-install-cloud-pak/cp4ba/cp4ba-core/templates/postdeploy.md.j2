Wait for Operators to do another cycle to make your changes effective.

### Deploy toolkits and configurators

Based on https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/latest?topic=reference-downloadable-toolkits

To your local system download the following

Some of them are used as Configurators, don't be confused that they don't appear in the list of toolkits.  

## Business Automation Insights (BAI) (foundation pattern)

### Configure Workforce insights

Part of WFI configuration has already been done automatically.

Set up WFI following https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/latest?topic=charts-enabling-workforce-insights

## Operational Decision Manager (ODM) (decisions pattern)

### BAI event emitter

After you have some rule project ready, configure it to emit BAI events using https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/odm/latest?topic=properties-built-in-ruleset-odm-event-emitter

### Rule designer in eclipse

Follow https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/latest?topic=manager-installing-rule-designer

### Rule designer Zen connection

Follow https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/latest?topic=manager-importing-security-certificate-in-rule-designer  
The truststore.jks can be downloaded from https://cpd-{{ cp4ba_project_name }}.{{ apps_endpoint_domain }}/odm/decisioncenter/assets/truststore.jks  

Please note that after using this trust store, eclipse marketplace and updates might stop to work. To overcome this, you can to extract the certificates from downloaded truststore.jks, make a copy of java cacerts, import the extracted certificates into it and use the newly created cacerts.

When configuring RES connection in Deployment use  
URL: https://cpd-{{ cp4ba_project_name }}.{{ apps_endpoint_domain }}/odm/res  
Method: Zen API Key  
UserID: cpmanagerservice  
API Key: As found in Project {{ _current_cp4ba_cluster.project }}, ConfigMap 000-{{ cp4ba_project_name }}-usage, key cpmanagerservice-zen-api-key

When configuring Decision Center use  
URL: https://cpd-{{ cp4ba_project_name }}.{{ apps_endpoint_domain }}/odm/decisioncenter  
Authentication: Zen API Key  
User ID: cpmanagerservice  
API Key: As found in Project {{ _current_cp4ba_cluster.project }}, ConfigMap 000-{{ cp4ba_project_name }}-usage, key cpmanagerservice-zen-api-key

## Automation Decision Services (ADS) (decisions_ads pattern)

Based on https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/latest?topic=tasks-automation-decision-services

### ADS project git repo & connection

ADS is set up to create repositories for Projects automatically. If you need to switch to specifically named repo, you can use the following procedure.  
Create Repository. Change *name* in the payload to correspond to your project name.
```bash
curl --insecure --request POST "https://gitea-{{ gitea_project_name }}.{{ apps_endpoint_domain }}/api/v1/orgs/ads/repos" \
--header  "Content-Type: application/json" \
--user '{{ lc_principal_admin_user }}:{{ lc_principal_admin_password }}' \
--data-raw '
{
  "auto_init": false,
  "default_branch": "master",
  "description": "",
  "gitignores": "",
  "issue_labels": "",
  "license": "",
  "name": "sandbox",
  "private": true,
  "readme": "",
  "template": false,
  "trust_model": "default"
}
'
```

Open your ADS Sandbox project  
On the top right, click Connect  

Repository URI: https://gitea-{{ gitea_project_name }}.{{ apps_endpoint_domain }}/ads/sandbox.git  (adjust *sandbox*)  
Username: {{ lc_principal_admin_user }}  
Password: {{ lc_principal_admin_password }}  
Click Connect

### Develop custom libraries

To find out how to create and add External libraries to ADS, follow https://github.com/icp4a/automation-decision-services-samples/tree/24.0.0/samples/ExternalLibraryStartTutorial

To be able to follow the above guide from my environment, I needed to perform the following.

Add settings for Nexus in my local maven settings .m2\settings.xml (Available in Project *{{ _current_cp4ba_cluster.project }}*, in ConfigMap *000-{{ _current_cp4ba_cluster.project }}-nexus-maven-settings* in *settings.xml* file)  


Installed JDK 16 Oracle, added to path.

Add OCP ingress certificates to jdk/jre cacerts.  
Run mvn command with -Djavax.net.debug=ssl to determine the location of used cacerts file.  
In my case: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-16.0.1\lib\security\cacerts  
Open KeyStore Explorer as Administrator, open this cacerts, no password.  
Import ca.crt which is available in *{{ cp4ba_project_name }}* Project in external-tls-secret Secret, save without password.  

Installed VSCode and added Java Extension Pack

### Configure GenAI secret parameters

Based on https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/latest?topic=services-configuring-generative-ai-secret

The configuration in CR and Secret creation was already done for you. You now need to provide the connection details in the Secret *ads-genai-secret* in Project {{ cp4ba_project_name }}.
Then the ADS pods restart automatically and that enables GenAI successful connection from ADS Designer.

## FileNet Content Manager (FNCM) (content pattern)

Based on https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/latest?topic=tasks-filenet-content-manager

### IER configuration

Follow official documentation at https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/latest?topic=fcm-configuring-enterprise-records,
https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/enterprise-records/latest?topic=in-configuring-content-navigator-task-manager-enterprise-records#frmco011__1 to finish IER configuration.  
URLs are available in *{{ _current_cp4ba_cluster.project }}* Project in *000-{{ cp4ba_project_name }}-usage* ConfigMap (IER application plugin URL).

Some steps were already automated:
- FPOS and ROS object stores were created
- Task Manager pod has TM_JOB_URL parameter set (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/enterprise-records/latest?topic=in-configuring-content-navigator-task-manager-enterprise-records)
- CPE Jars (Jace.jar, pe.jar and peResources.jar) were added to Task manager (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/enterprise-records/latest?topic=in-configuring-content-navigator-task-manager-enterprise-records)
- Task manager pod restarted (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/enterprise-records/latest?topic=in-configuring-content-navigator-task-manager-enterprise-records)
- TM-Liberty.xml addition is not necesarry as it is already generated by the operator

You need to at least:
- Run IER config mgr to setup FPOS and ROS for IER
- Add and setup IER plugin in ICN
- Add Additional Jars to Task manager and restart it (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/enterprise-records/latest?topic=in-configuring-content-navigator-task-manager-enterprise-records)
