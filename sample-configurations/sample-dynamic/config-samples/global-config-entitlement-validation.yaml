# Global configuration for entitlement image validation
# This feature validates that your entitlement key has access to required images
# before deployment begins, preventing failures during installation.

global_config:
  environment_name: sample
  cloud_platform: existing-ocp
  
  # Entitlement validation configuration
  entitlement_validation:
    # Enable or disable pre-flight entitlement validation
    # When enabled, validates access to representative images before deployment
    # Default: true
    enabled: true
    
    # Whether to fail deployment if unauthorized images are found
    # Set to false to only warn about validation failures
    # Default: true
    fail_on_error: true
    
    # Number of sample images to validate per component (smart sampling)
    # Higher values = more thorough validation but longer validation time
    # Recommended: 2-3 images per component (reduces time from 10+ min to <1 min)
    # Default: 3
    sample_size: 3
    
    # Optional: List of specific images to skip validation
    # Useful for known issues or custom images
    # skip_images:
    #   - "cp.icr.io/cp/cpd/specific-image@sha256:..."

# Example: Disable validation for air-gapped environments
# entitlement_validation:
#   enabled: false

# Example: Warn only, don't fail deployment
# entitlement_validation:
#   enabled: true
#   fail_on_error: false
#   sample_size: 2
